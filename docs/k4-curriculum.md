# Implementation Notes

## Question Generation Strategy

### Better AI Prompts
The current AI question generation uses basic prompts. We'll improve by:

1. **Curriculum-Aware Prompts**
   - Include grade-level expectations
   - Specify question type (MCQ, short answer)
   - Include difficulty parameters

2. **Template-Based Generation**
   - Create question templates per skill
   - AI fills in the variables
   - Human validates output

3. **Quality Filters**
   - Validate against grade-level standards
   - Check for age-appropriate content
   - Ensure single correct answer

### Question Structure
```json
{
  "curriculum_node_id": "math-2nd-addition",
  "question_type": "mcq",
  "content": "Question text",
  "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
  "grade_level": 2,
  "skill": "2-digit addition"
}
```

## Database Structure

### Topics (Subjects)
- Math (id: 1)
- Reading (id: 2)
- Science (id: 3)
- Social Studies (id: 4)
- Hebrew (id: 5)

### Curriculum Nodes
Each topic has multiple nodes by grade and skill.

### Question Tags
Questions tagged with:
- Grade level (K, 1, 2, 3, 4)
